In phase II studies, tralokinumab combined with topical corticosteroids provided early and sustained improvements in AD signs and symptoms. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of tralokinumab monotherapy in adults with moderate-to-severe AD who had an inadequate response to topical treatments. Methods: In two 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trials, ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2, adults with moderate-to-severe AD were randomized (3 : 1) to subcutaneous tralokinumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or placebo.
