Objectives: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and effects on systemic biomarkers of ASN002 in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Methods A total of 36 patients with moderate-to-severe AD were randomized (3:1) to ASN002 or placebo in the phase Ib study. Three dosage cohorts were studied over a 28-day period (20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg once daily). Results: ASN002 was superior to placebo for the proportion of patients achieving Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) 50 (20 mg 20%, P = 0.93; 40 mg 100%, P = 0.003; 80 mg 83%, P = 0.03; placebo 22%), EASI 75 (20 mg 0%, P = 0.27; 40 mg 71%, P = 0.06; 80 mg 33%, P = 0.65; placebo 22%) and in change from baseline in pruritus (20 mg -1.3 +/- 2.1, P = 0.81; 40 mg -3.1 +/- 2.7, P = 0.27; 80 mg -4.7 +/- 2.1, P = 0.01; placebo -1.6 +/- 1.8). Adverse events were generally mild and similar across all groups. ASN002 showed dose-dependent plasma exposure with low interpatient variability, significantly downregulated several serum biomarkers involved in Th1, Th2 and Th17/Th22 immunity, and decreased the atherosclerosis-associated biomarker E selectin/SELE.
