Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of tralokinumab in combination with topical corticosteroids(TCS) in patients with moderate-to-severe AD who were candidates for systemic therapy. Methods: This was a double-blind, placebo plus TCS controlled phase III trial. Patients were randomized 2 : 1 to subcutaneous tralokinumab 300 mg or placebo every 2 weeks(Q2W) with TCS as needed over 16 weeks. Patients who achieved an Investigators Global Assessment(IGA) score of 0/1 and/or 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index(EASI 75) at week 16 with tralokinumab were rerandomized 1 : 1 to tralokinumab Q2W or every 4 weeks (Q4W), with TCS as needed, for another 16 weeks.

Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of tralokinumab in combination with topical corticosteroids(TCS) in patients with moderate-to-severe AD who were candidates for systemic therapy. Methods: This was a double-blind, placebo plus TCS controlled phase III trial. Patients were randomized 2 : 1 to subcutaneous tralokinumab 300 mg or placebo every 2 weeks(Q2W) with TCS as needed over 16 weeks. Patients who achieved an Investigators Global Assessment(IGA) score of 0/1 and/or 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index(EASI 75) at week 16 with tralokinumab were rerandomized 1 : 1 to tralokinumab Q2W or every 4 weeks (Q4W), with TCS as needed, for another 16 weeks. Results: At week 16, more patients treated with tralokinumab than with placebo achieved IGA 0/1: 38�9% vs. 26�2% [difference (95% confidence interval): 12�4% (2�9-21�9); P = 0�015] and EASI 75: 56�0% vs. 35�7% [20�2% (9�8-30�6); P < 0�001].
