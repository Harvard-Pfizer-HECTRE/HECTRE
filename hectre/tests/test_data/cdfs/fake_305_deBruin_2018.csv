Dupilumab, a fully human anti-interleukin 4 receptor-alpha monoclonal antibody, inhibits signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, key drivers of Type 2/Th2-mediated inflammation, and is approved in the USA and the European Union for the treatment of inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults. Objectives: To evaluate efficacy and safety of dupilumab with concomitant topical corticosteroids (topical corticosteroids ) in adults with atopic dermatitis with inadequate response to/intolerance of CsA, or for whom CsA treatment was medically inadvisable. Methods: In this 16 week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III trial, patients were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to subcutaneous dupilumab 300 mg weekly (qw) or every 2 weeks (q2w) or placebo. All received concomitant medium-potency topical corticosteroids from Week -2 through Week 16; dosage could be tapered if lesions cleared, or stopped for adverse reactions to topical corticosteroids. Results: In total, 390 patients were screened, 325 were randomized, and 318 completed the trial. Treatment groups had similar baseline characteristics.

All received concomitant medium-potency topical corticosteroids from Week -2 through Week 16; dosage could be tapered if lesions cleared, or stopped for adverse reactions to topical corticosteroids. Results: In total, 390 patients were screened, 325 were randomized, and 318 completed the trial. Treatment groups had similar baseline characteristics. Significantly more patients in the dupilumab qw + topical corticosteroids and q2w + topical corticosteroids groups achieved >= 75% improvement from baseline in the Eczema Area and Severity Index at Week 16 vs. the placebo + topical corticosteroids group (primary end point) (59.1% and 62.6% vs. 29.6%, respectively; P < 0·001 vs. placebo + topical corticosteroids , both doses). Other clinical outcomes and atopic dermatitis symptoms were significantly improved in the dupilumab qw + topical corticosteroids and q2w + topical corticosteroids groups, including pruritus, pain, sleep disturbance, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and quality of life (QoL). Treatment groups had similar overall rates of adverse events (qw + topical corticosteroids, q2w + topical corticosteroids and placebo + topical corticosteroids groups: 69.1%, 72.0% and 69.4%, respectively) and serious adverse events (1.8%, 1.9% and 1.9%, respectively). Conjunctivitis was more frequent with dupilumab + topical corticosteroids; skin infections were more frequent with placebo + topical corticosteroids . Conclusions: Dupilumab + topical corticosteroids significantly improved signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis and QoL in adults with a history of inadequate response to/intolerance of CsA, or for whom CsA treatment was medically inadvisable.
