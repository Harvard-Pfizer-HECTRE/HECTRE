Patients who achieved an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0/1 and/or 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 75) at week 16 with tralokinumab were rerandomized 1 : 1 to tralokinumab Q2W or every 4 weeks (Q4W), with TCS as needed, for another 16 weeks. Results At week 16, more patients treated with tralokinumab than with placebo achieved IGA 0/1: 38.9% vs. 26.2% [difference (95% confidence interval): 12.4% (2.9-21.9); P=0.015] and EASI 75: 56.0% vs. 35.7% [20.2% (9.8-30.6); P<0.001]. Of the patients who were tralokinumab responders at week 16, 89.6% and 92.5% of those treated with tralokinumab Q2W and 77.6% and 90.8% treated with tralokinumab Q4W maintained an IGA 0/1 and EASI 75 response at week 32, respectively. Among patients who did not achieve IGA 0/1 and EASI 75 with tralokinumab Q2W at 16 weeks, 30.5% and 55.8% achieved these endpoints, respectively, at week 32. The overall incidence of adverse events was similar across treatment groups.
