# HECTRE Back-End APIs

## Quickstart on Using the APIs

Currently you can just try to invoke the Llama 2 model and see the results.
1. Make sure to have installed Python with at least version 3.8.
2. Make sure AWS credentials are in you root directory under .aws folder.
3. Set the credential profile name to be "capstone".
4. You can run the `local_test.py` with `python -m src.local_test` (or just `python -m local_test` if you are already in the /src directory).
5. Feel free to change `local_test.py` to test out other prompts, or change `config.ini` to change model configurations.
