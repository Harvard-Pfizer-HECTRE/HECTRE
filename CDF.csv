Background Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that may require
systemic therapy. Ciclosporin A (CsA) is a widely used, potent immunosuppressant
but it is not effective in all patients with atopic dermatitis, and side-effects limit its
use. Dupilumab, a fully human anti-interleukin 4 receptor-alpha monoclonal anti-
body, inhibits signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, key drivers of Type 2/Th2-mediated
inflammation, and is approved in the U.S.A. and the European Union for the treat-ment of inadequately-controlled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults.
Objectives To evaluate efficacy and safety of dupilumab with concomitant topical
corticosteroids (TCS) in adults with atopic dermatitis with inadequate response
to/intolerance of CsA, or for whom CsA treatment was medically inadvisable.
Methods In this 16-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III
trial, patients were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to subcutaneous dupilumab 300 mg
weekly (qw) or every 2 weeks (q2w) or placebo. All received concomitant med-
ium-potency TCS from Week -2 through Week 16; dosage could be tapered if
lesions cleared, or stopped for adverse reactions to TCS.
Results In total, 390 patients were screened, 325 were randomized, and 318 com-
pleted the trial. Treatment groups had similar baseline characteristics. Significantly
more patients in the dupilumab qw +TCS and q2w +TCS groups achieved ≥75%
improvement from baseline in the Eczema Area and Severity Index at Week 16 vs.
the placebo +TCS group (primary end point) (59 .1% and 62 .6% vs. 29 .6%,
respectively; P<0.001 vs. placebo +TCS, both doses). Other clinical outcomes
and atopic dermatitis symptoms were significantly improved in the dupilumab qw
